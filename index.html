            <p>Complete details on each type of Personal Data collected are provided in the dedicated sections of this

              Application.<br>Unless specified otherwise, all Data requested by this Application is mandatory and
              failure to provide this Data may make it impossible for this Application to provide its services. In cases
              where this Application specifically states that some Data is not mandatory, Users are free not to

              who are uncertain about which Personal Data is mandatory are welcome to contact the Owner.<br>Any use of
              Cookies – or of other tracking tools – by this Application or by the owners of third-party services used
              by this Application serves the purpose of providing the Service required by the User, in addition to any
              other purposes described in the present document and in the Cookie Policy, if available.</p>
            <p>Users are responsible for any third-party Personal Data obtained, published or shared through this
              Application and confirm that they have the third party's consent to provide the Data to the Owner.</p>

            <h2 id="place_of_processing">Mode and place of processing the Data</h2>
            <h3>Methods of processing</h3>
            <p>The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification,
              or unauthorized destruction of the Data.<br>The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT
              enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated.
              In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge,
              involved with the operation of this Application (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system
              administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical service providers, mail carriers,
              hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by
              the Owner. The updated list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.</p>
            <h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>
            <p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the
                Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”),
                without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not
                apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;</li>
              <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any
                pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li>
              <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;</li>
              <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
                official authority vested in the Owner;</li>
              <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a
                third party.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the
              processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual
              requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract. </p>
            <h3>Place</h3>
            <p>The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved
              in the processing are located.<br><br>
              Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a country
              other than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can
              check the section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.</p>
            <p>Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the
              European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two
              or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their
              Data.<br><br>
              If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this
              document or inquire with the Owner using the information provided in the contact section.</p>
            <h3>Retention time</h3>
            <p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been
              collected for.</p>
            <p>Therefore:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner and
                the User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.</li>
              <li>Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be retained as long
                as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate
                interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the Owner.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent
              to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to
              retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal
              obligation or upon order of an authority.<br><br>
              Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the
              right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after
              expiration of the retention period.</p>

              to access the User's device Data as described below.</p>
            <p>By default, these permissions must be granted by the User before the respective information can be

              revoke these permissions, Users may refer to the device settings or contact the Owner for support at the
              contact details provided in the present document.<br>The exact procedure for controlling app permissions
              may be dependent on the User's device and software.</p>
            <p>Please note that the revoking of such permissions might impact the proper functioning of this
              Application.</p>
            <p>If User grants any of the permissions listed below, the respective Personal Data may be processed (i.e

            <p>Users may exercise certain rights regarding their Data processed by the Owner.</p>
            <p>In particular, Users have the right to do the following:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Withdraw their consent at any time.</b> Users have the right to withdraw consent where they have
                previously given their consent to the processing of their Personal Data.</li>
              <li><b>Object to processing of their Data.</b> Users have the right to object to the processing of their
                Data if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent. Further details are provided
                in the dedicated section below.</li>
              <li><b>Access their Data.</b> Users have the right to learn if Data is being processed by the Owner,
                obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the Data undergoing
                processing.</li>
              <li><b>Verify and seek rectification.</b> Users have the right to verify the accuracy of their Data and
                ask for it to be updated or corrected.</li>
              <li><b>Restrict the processing of their Data.</b> Users have the right, under certain circumstances, to
                restrict the processing of their Data. In this case, the Owner will not process their Data for any
                purpose other than storing it.
              </li>
              <li><b>Have their Personal Data deleted or otherwise removed.</b> Users have the right, under certain
                circumstances, to obtain the erasure of their Data from the Owner.</li>

                receive their Data in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically
                feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This provision is
                applicable provided that the Data is processed by automated means and that the processing is based on
                the User's consent, on a contract which the User is part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.
              </li>

            <h3>Details about the right to object to processing</h3>
            <p>Where Personal Data is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested
              in the Owner or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner, Users may object to
              such processing by providing a ground related to their particular situation to justify the objection.</p>
            <p>Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed for direct marketing purposes,
              they can object to that processing at any time without providing any justification. To learn, whether the
              Owner is processing Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, Users may refer to the relevant sections
              of this document. </p>
